BOT IS SUUUPER SIMPLE WRITTEN IN 1H SO IT PROBABLY HAS MANY IMPERFECTIONS.
FEEL FREE TO CORRECT ME AND LEAVE ME SOME FEEDBACK :D

Preparation:
Log on to the character you want to level up (after lvl 60 most effective)
Keep your computers' focus on the WoW window
Go to group finder and choose pvp
Close group finder
Set your " Stormpike Insignia " on the button " 1 "
Run the bot 

Step by step explanation:
1. Bot is going to open the group finder by clicking " I " (thats why it is so important that pvp page was previously chosen)
2. Your mouse poiner is then going to immiediatly go to Korrak's Revenge, click it, move to the "join" button and then also click it.
3. Then it will wait for 160 seconds (easily changeble if faster queues) and click the join battle notification.
4. After waiting 3 minutes it is going to leave the cave and teleport near the Dun Baldar fortress.
5. It is calibrated to go excatly to the further right corner of the main room where you are not on the map, so nobody can report you.
6. Then it begins the anti-afking sequence. 
7. After 42 minutes the process should restart.

Disclaimer: When the horde enters the throne room, they will probably kill you, but don't worry because you will respawn automatically and the anti afking will not stop working and you'll surely get that sweet sweet xp at the end of the bg.

The biggest problem is to draft the queueing time, but i found that 160 is closest to the average. If queues are way faster, I recommend 148.
